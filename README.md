data_numbers.txt contains all numbers (such as total assets, current assets, net income, etc...)
data_ratios.txt contains all the ratios to be fed into our model

NOTE: Running Financial_Statement_Parsing will not recreate the same file as manual input was necessary for the completion of the data_numbers.txt file, which generated the data_ratios.txt file

NOTE 2: The companies that are to be neglected due to missing net sales or assets/liabilities are 
"LEN", "GMO", "NG", "TMQ", "UEC", "VGZ", "WWR", "XPL"
